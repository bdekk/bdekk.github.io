Hello and welcome. My name is Bram Dekker. I am 24 years old and a Dutch student and Programmer living in the city of Leiden, The Netherlands. I study IT in Business at the University of Leiden and in my spare time I like to do some programming for different platforms and in different programming languages. Currently I am working on social apps and IoT related software.

If you want to talk about IT related subjects or just have a nice general chat, feel free to contact me and perhaps we'll meet up for a coffee or beer.
